              The arbitration panel shall consist of one individual appointed by

              the other provisions of these Terms of Use, all of which shall

              interpreted so as best to reasonably effect the intent of the
              parties.  The parties further agree to replace any such invalid or
              unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision
